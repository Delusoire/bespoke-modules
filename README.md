For a list of all available tasks, refer to the [deno config file](deno.json).

Some tasks have `pw:*` (for Windows) and `sh:*` (for Linux and MacOS) variants, make sure to run the ones corresponding to your Platform.

```shell
deno task cm:fetch
deno task <pw or sh>:build
deno task <pw or sh>:enable
```
